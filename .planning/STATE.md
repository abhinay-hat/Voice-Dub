# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-31)

**Core value:** Watch any video content in English while preserving the original speaker's voice characteristics and emotional expression, without relying on cloud services or paying API fees.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Environment & Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (Environment & Foundation)
Plan: 3 of 3 (phase complete)
Status: Phase 1 complete
Last activity: 2026-01-31 — Completed 01-03-PLAN.md (GPU Environment Verification)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 30%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 119 minutes
- Total execution time: 6.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01    | 3     | 358m  | 119m     |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (337m), 01-02 (6m), 01-03 (15m)
- Trend: Plans 01-02 and 01-03 much faster (building on foundation vs initial setup)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- XTTS-v2 for voice cloning (best open-source with emotion preservation)
- Meta Seamless for translation (preserves vocal expression)
- Whisper Large V3 for speech-to-text (99+ languages, high accuracy)
- Gradio for web UI (simplest for friends to use)
- PyTorch + CUDA stack (RTX 5090 native support)
- Wav2Lip HD or LatentSync for lip sync (good quality with acceptable speed)

**CRITICAL HARDWARE UPDATE:**
Research assumed AMD GPU/ROCm, but actual hardware is RTX 5090 (32GB VRAM) + CUDA. This means:
- Native PyTorch CUDA support (simpler than ROCm)
- Better model compatibility (no community forks needed)
- Faster processing (10-20 min vs 1 hour for 20-min video)
- Multiple models can load simultaneously (32GB VRAM)
- Update stack to use standard CUDA implementations

**Phase 01-01 Decisions:**

| ID | Title | Impact | Status |
|----|-------|--------|--------|
| cuda-128-nightly | Use PyTorch nightly with CUDA 12.8 | Required for RTX 5090 sm_120 support | ✅ Implemented |
| comprehensive-validation | 6-step GPU validation with allocation test | Prevents silent CPU fallback | ✅ Implemented |
| python-311 | Use Python 3.11 instead of 3.13 | Fully compatible, already available | ✅ Implemented |

**Phase 01-02 Decisions:**

| ID | Title | Impact | Status |
|----|-------|--------|--------|
| sequential-model-loading | Sequential model loading pattern | Prevents VRAM exhaustion on 32GB RTX 5090 | ✅ Implemented |
| 4-step-cleanup | 4-step model cleanup protocol | Ensures complete VRAM release without leaks | ✅ Implemented |
| stage-based-directory-structure | Stage-based src/ organization | Maps to 11-phase pipeline architecture | ✅ Implemented |

**Phase 01-03 Decisions:**

| ID | Title | Impact | Status |
|----|-------|--------|--------|
| comprehensive-test-suite | 4-test environment validation suite | Validates GPU, memory, model loading, env vars | ✅ Implemented |
| hardware-requirements-first | Front-load RTX 5090 requirements in README | Users know compatibility immediately | ✅ Implemented |
| sm120-troubleshooting | Dedicated troubleshooting for sm_120 issues | Users can self-solve common RTX 5090 problems | ✅ Implemented |

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

~~**Phase 1:** Hardware update requires stack validation (PyTorch CUDA not ROCm, standard model implementations not ROCm forks)~~ ✅ RESOLVED (01-01)
- PyTorch nightly 2.11.0.dev20260130+cu128 installed
- RTX 5090 sm_120 support verified
- GPU validation utility confirms 31.84 GB VRAM accessible

**Phase 1 Complete:** Foundation established, ready for Phase 2 (Video Processing Pipeline)
- ✅ RTX 5090 environment validated with sm_120 compute capability
- ✅ Sequential model loading prevents VRAM exhaustion
- ✅ Memory monitoring utilities track VRAM usage
- ✅ Project structure established
- ✅ Automated test suite validates environment
- ✅ Setup documentation enables reproduction

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-31 (plan 01-03 execution)
Stopped at: Completed 01-03-PLAN.md - GPU environment verification complete, Phase 1 finished
